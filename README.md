## Opportunity Statement

If you've ever tried to find information about a wheeled vehicle on the internet, you may have noticed that while
information is readily available, it's scattered throughout many sources, forums, wikis, and other data repositories.
The goal of this API is to create a searchable library of relevant vehicle information, quickly accessible via the API 
infrastructure, with full CRUD functionality. Users will be able to access various information about a given vehicle 
(stats, mpg, short summary, etc.) and will be able to update it if any errors are found.
