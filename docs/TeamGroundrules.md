# Team Ground Rules

## Our attitude and culture:

- We treat each other with respect.
- We intend to develop personal relationships to enhance trust and open communication.
- We value constructive feedback. We will avoid being defensive and give feedback in a constructive manner.
- We treat subcontractor and customer team members in the same way as contractor team members.
- We strive to recognize and celebrate individual and team accomplishments.
- As team members, we will pitch in to help where necessary to help solve problems and catch-up on behind schedule work.

## Team Meetings:

- Full team meeting will only be held if the team as a whole deams it necessary.
- Regular communication via slack will the the prefered method of communication.
- All team members are expected to inform the other members if they plan on being out of town, on vacation or sick. If a team member is unavailable, he or she should have a designated, empowered representative (anothter team member, a representative from their functional organization, etc.) attend in their place.
- Meetings will start promptly on time. All members are expected to be on-time.
- An action item list with responsibilities will be maintained, reviewed in meetings, and distributed with the meeting minutes.
- No responsibilities will be assigned unless the person be assigned the responsibility accepts it. If a person to be given a responsibility is not at meeting, the team leader must review that assignment or action item with the person before the responsibility is designated.
- We will emphasize full discussion and resolution of issues vs. sticking to a timetable.

## Communication and Decision-Making:

- Each person is given a chance to speak their mind while at the same time respecting the group’s time and the meeting timetables. We will be brief and focus on facts, not opinions.
- We emphasize open and honest communication – there are no hidden agendas.
- We de-personalize discussion of issues – no attacks on people.
- We will listen, be non-judgmental and keep an open mind on issues until it is time to decide.
- We emphasize balanced participation of all team members.
- We will emphasize collaboration and use consensus for important decisions and issues. For less important issues, we will rely on the subject matter expert with input from others. Planning and Management
- We will mutually commit to our team’s objectives as stated in the team charter or negotiate until we can make this mutual commitment.
- We accept the responsibility and accountability along with the authority given to us.
- If a team member believes they are being asked to do a task outside the scope of the team’s charter,he/she will bring this to the attention of the team leader for resolution.
- When we pose an issue or a problem, we will also try to present a solution.
- Team commitments shouldn’t be made lightly, but we will keep those that we do.

Other

- We will focus sufficient time on team process and conduct process checks when one member believes we are deviating from our ground rules.
